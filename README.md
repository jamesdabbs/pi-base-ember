# Pi-base

This is a provisional attempt at splitting Pi-Base into an API / client architecture, and writing the frontend in Ember. It is by no means complete, but does illustrate some Ember basics and the direction the site is likely to head if I can secure some sustained collaborators. For now, development will continue on the main integrated Yesod site.
